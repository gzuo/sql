**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

As a software engineer working in a publication company, I would incorporate ethics into my work by ensuring the accuracy, privacy, and security of the metadata and sales data I handle. I would implement strict protocols to safeguard consumer information and respect data privacy laws such as GDPR. Transparency would be a key principle, informing stakeholders about data usage and obtaining necessary consents. I would also be responsible for ensuring that the data I collect, and share is accurate and unbiased, providing a reliable foundation for business decisions and maintaining the trust of both our company and our customers.

In addressing inequity components, I would focus on identifying and mitigating any biases in the data collection and analysis processes. I would ensure that the metadata and sales data represent a diverse range of books and authors, preventing any unintentional favoritism towards specific genres, authors, or demographics. Additionally, I would analyze the sales data to understand how different groups of consumers are impacted by various factors such as pricing and promotions. I would help create more inclusive and equitable business strategies that promote fairness and diversity in the marketplace.
